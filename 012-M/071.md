# Incorrect `harvest()` function execution in a situation when `providerRatio == 0`.

## Summary

Rewards are not collected and moved to the savings account when `providerRatio == 0` during `harvest()` call.

## Vulnerability Detail

The harvest function contains the check `if (duration == 0 || amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration) return;`, which is intended to prevent the distribution of rewards to users in cases where the rewards would be lost.

However, in a valid edge case where the admin decides that all rewards from the Market contract should go to the savings account, this check will block the process (amount will be 0). In this scenario, rewards will not be collected from the `provider` even if the intention is to transfer them to the `savings` account.

This situation can occur because the system supports multiple reward tokens, and the admin may decide that the rewards from the Market should be excluded and moved to the `savings` address.

## Impact

This issue results in a loss of funds for the protocol as tokens cannot be collected and transferred to the `savings` address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow reward collection from the `provider` and transfer them to the `savings` address when `providerRatio == 0`.

```diff
function harvest() public whenNotPaused {
    Market memMarket = market;
    address memProvider = provider;
    uint256 assets = Math.min(
      memMarket.convertToAssets(memMarket.allowance(memProvider, address(this))),
      memMarket.maxWithdraw(memProvider)
    );
    uint256 amount = assets.mulWadDown(providerRatio);
    IERC20 providerAsset = IERC20(address(memMarket.asset()));
    uint256 duration = rewards[providerAsset].duration;
-   if (duration == 0 || amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration) return;
+   if ((duration == 0 || amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration) && providerRatio > 0) return;

    memMarket.withdraw(assets, address(this), memProvider);
    uint256 save = assets - amount;
    if (save != 0) memMarket.deposit(save, savings);

-   notifyRewardAmount(providerAsset, amount, address(this));
+   if (amount != 0) notifyRewardAmount(providerAsset, amount, address(this));
}
```
