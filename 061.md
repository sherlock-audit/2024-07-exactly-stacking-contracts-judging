# Allowance Usage in `harvest` Function Could Lead to Insufficient Funds for Operations

## Summary
See Below
## Vulnerability Detail
The `harvest` function in the provided smart contract utilizes the same allowance for both the `withdraw` and `deposit` operations from the `memMarket` contract. This can create a situation where the contract might not have sufficient allowance to perform both operations successfully.

Code Snippet:
```solidity
function harvest() public whenNotPaused {
    Market memMarket = market;
    address memProvider = provider;
    uint256 assets = Math.min(
        memMarket.convertToAssets(memMarket.allowance(memProvider, address(this))),
        memMarket.maxWithdraw(memProvider)
    );
    uint256 amount = assets.mulWadDown(providerRatio);
    IERC20 providerAsset = IERC20(address(memMarket.asset()));
    uint256 duration = rewards[providerAsset].duration;
    if (duration == 0 || amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration) return;

    memMarket.withdraw(assets, address(this), memProvider); // Using provider's allowance
    uint256 save = assets - amount;
    if (save != 0) memMarket.deposit(save, savings); // Using same allowance

    notifyRewardAmount(providerAsset, amount, address(this));
}

```
1. **Allowance and Max Withdraw Limits**: The function calculates the `assets` to withdraw based on the minimum of the allowable amount (`memMarket.allowance`) and the maximum withdrawable amount (`memMarket.maxWithdraw`).

- Allowance: The `memMarket.allowance` function returns the maximum amount that the contract is allowed to withdraw.
- Max Withdraw: The `memMarket.maxWithdraw` function returns the maximum amount that can be withdrawn considering the provider’s limits.
If the `allowance` is set very high but the `maxWithdraw` limit is very low, the contract may withdraw the maximum allowed by `maxWithdraw`, which could be significantly less than the `allowance`. This mismatch can lead to discrepancies in the actual operations versus the intended operations.
2. **Withdrawal Operation**: The function proceeds to withdraw assets using the provider’s `allowance`. However, if the `allowance` is higher than `maxWithdraw`, the effective limit for the withdrawal is constrained by `maxWithdraw`.
3. **Deposit Operation**: After withdrawal, the function attempts to deposit any remaining assets back into savings. If the allowance is not sufficient to cover both operations, the deposit operation might fail even if the withdrawal operation succeeded.
## Impact
The primary impact of this issue is that if the allowance set by the provider is insufficient to cover both the withdrawal and deposit operations, the transaction will fail during the deposit step. This could result in an inconsistent state (Possibly a DOS ) or failure to complete intended operations.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the `allowance` set by the provider is sufficient to cover both the `withdraw` and `deposit` operations. Additionally, perform checks to verify the allowance before proceeding with these operations.
