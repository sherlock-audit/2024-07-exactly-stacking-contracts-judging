# Price Scaling Discrepancy in assetPrice Function

## Summary
The Auditor contract contains a critical vulnerability in its price calculation mechanism. The assetPrice function incorrectly assumes that all price feeds return prices with the same number of decimal places as specified in the constructor. This assumption can lead to incorrect price scaling when price feeds with different decimal places are used.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the constructor of the Market contract, the baseFactor is calculated as follows:
```solidity
baseFactor = 10 ** (18 - priceDecimals_); // For priceDecimals_ = 6
// baseFactor = 10 ** (18 - 6) = 10 ** 12 = 1,000,000,000,000 (12 decimals)
```
When the assetPrice function retrieves the price from the price feed, it multiplies this price by baseFactor:
```solidity
int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer(); // Assume price returned is 1.5 (with 8 decimals)
if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
return uint256(price) * baseFactor; // If price = 1.5 (or 1.5 * 10^8 = 150000000)
```
If the price feed returns a price with 8 decimals (e.g., 1.5 represented as 150000000), and this is multiplied by baseFactor (which is 1,000,000,000,000), the result will be:
Result=150000000Ã—1000000000000=150000000000000000000

This result has 24 decimals, which can lead to discrepancies when interacting with other parts of the contract that expect a specific number of decimals.
## Impact
* Incorrect Asset Valuation: Assets may be significantly over or undervalued, depending on the decimal mismatch.
* Unfair Liquidations: Positions might be liquidated prematurely or not liquidated when they should be.

```solidty

  /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
  constructor(uint256 priceDecimals_) {
    priceDecimals = priceDecimals_;
    baseFactor = 10 ** (18 - priceDecimals_);
    basePrice = 10 ** priceDecimals_;

    _disableInitializers();
  }

```

```solidity
/// @notice Gets the asset price of a price feed.
  /// @dev If Chainlink's asset price is <= 0 the call is reverted.
  /// @param priceFeed address of Chainlink's Price Feed aggregator used to query the asset price.
  /// @return The price of the asset scaled to 18-digit decimals.
  function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    return uint256(price) * baseFactor;  
  }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Dynamically fetch the decimal places from each price feed:
```solidity
function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;
    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    uint8 feedDecimals = priceFeed.decimals();
    return uint256(price) * 10**(18 - feedDecimals);
}
```
