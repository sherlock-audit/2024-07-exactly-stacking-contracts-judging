# Use safeTransfer consistently instead of transfer

## Summary
Use safeTransfer consistently instead of transfer
## Vulnerability Detail
The `tranfser` is directly used to send tokens in many places in the contract and the return value is not checked.

Meanwhile, [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) compliance notes are as follows:
    > Callers MUST handle false from returns (bool success). Callers MUST NOT assume that false is never returned!

Especially, Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false (e.g. ZRX).

For example, in the clear function, if debt token is ZRX, the lender can clear request without providing any debt token.
```solidity
  function claimWithdraw(IERC20 reward, address account, uint256 amount) internal {
    uint256 balance = balanceOf(account);
    uint256 numerator = claimed[account][reward] * amount;
    uint256 claimedAmount = numerator == 0 ? 0 : (numerator - 1) / balance + 1;
    claimed[account][reward] -= claimedAmount;

    numerator = saved[account][reward] * amount;
    uint256 savedAmount = numerator == 0 ? 0 : (numerator - 1) / balance + 1;
    saved[account][reward] -= savedAmount;

    uint256 claimableAmount = Math.max(rawClaimable(reward, account, amount), claimedAmount); // due to excess exposure
    uint256 claimAmount = claimableAmount - claimedAmount;
    if (claimAmount != 0) {
-->   reward.transfer(account, claimAmount);
      emit RewardPaid(reward, account, claimAmount);
    }

    uint256 rawEarned = earned(reward, account, amount);
    // due to rounding
    uint256 saveAmount = rawEarned <= claimableAmount + savedAmount ? 0 : rawEarned - claimableAmount - savedAmount;
--> if (saveAmount != 0) reward.transfer(savings, saveAmount);
  }
```

The ZRX token is a token that fully complies with ERC-20, and the sherlock readme does not specifically mention integrating tokens.
Also, in the Discord channel, the protocol team mentioned that USDC (low decimal token) token, one of the weird tokens, can also be used as a reward token.
In this regard, not checking the return value of the transfer() function may cause serious problems.
## Impact
If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.
