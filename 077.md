# While Claiming It Should Be Checked If rewardToken Is The Underlying Asset

## Summary

If the reward token is the underlying asset , then while claiming it possible that the claimer claims the reward token amount which was deposited by a depositor , this means that if the depositor wishes to withdraw it might revert with the reason that there are not enough tokens in the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) It is possible that the underlying asset is the reward token , see this check here which verifies this -->

2.) The above case handles the situation perfectly , the amount which is meant for rewards is the difference between balance of the token in the contract and the total Assets which are token minted when a user deposits.

3.) Assume that currently there are no rewards from the market , there are just reward token (asset) in the contract that are from user deposits.

4.) A user then calls the claim function , which calls _claim , and say a large amount of rewards were accrued for his stake , this large amount will be transferred to the user but the amount that is consumed comes from user deposits and not the reward tokens from the market.

5.) Now if the user who previously deposited in the pool wishes to withdraw might experience a not enough funds error since in the previous step the reward tokens has been sent from the user deposits section , this might lead to accounting discrepancies.


## Impact

The reward amount would be paid from the user deposits  , this might result in withdraw transactions being reverted and the amount of underlying token in the contract would be incorrect .A similar approach to the notifyRewards should be taken .

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if the amount claimed in the claim amount is > rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - totalAssets() if token is underlying asset.
