# Gas Limit DoS due to Unlimited Loop in Reward Token Handling

## Summary
In the `StakedEXA.sol#enableReward()` function, the potential gas limit for the `rewardTokens` array was not properly considered. This oversight may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition when the `StakedEXA.sol#_update()` function is called, as it could exceed the `block.gasLimit`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `enableReward()` function in `StakedEXA.sol` is responsible for adding a new reward token by pushing it to the `rewardTokens` array:

```solidity
function enableReward(IERC20 reward) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (rewards[reward].finishAt != 0) revert AlreadyEnabled();

    rewards[reward].finishAt = uint40(block.timestamp);
    rewardsTokens.push(reward);

    emit RewardListed(reward, msg.sender);
}
```
As shown, there is no maximum length validation for the `rewardsTokens` array, allowing an arbitrary number of tokens to be added. 
The `_update()` function is triggered whenever a user interacts with the contract and is designed to iterate over all reward tokens to process and claim rewards:

```solidity
function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override whenNotPaused {
    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (from == address(0)) {
        uint256 start = avgStart[to];
        uint256 time = start != 0 ? block.timestamp * 1e18 - start : 0;
        uint256 memRefTime = refTime * 1e18;
        uint256 balance = balanceOf(to);
        uint256 total = amount + balance;

-->   for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardsTokens.length; ++i) {
            IERC20 reward = rewardsTokens[i];
            updateIndex(reward);

            if (time > memRefTime) {
                if (balance != 0) claimWithdraw(reward, to, balance);
                avgIndexes[to][reward] = rewards[reward].index;
            } else {
                if (balance != 0) claim_(reward);
                uint256 numerator = avgIndexes[to][reward] * balance + rewards[reward].index * amount;
                avgIndexes[to][reward] = numerator == 0 ? 0 : (numerator - 1) / total + 1;
            }
        }
        // Additional code...
    }
    // Additional code...

    super._update(from, to, amount);
}
```
The loop iterates through `rewardsTokens[]`, and if this array contains a high number of tokens, it could lead to a scenario where the transaction exceeds the gas limit. This poses a risk to core functions of the protocol, especially during state updates where `from` equals `address(0)`, potentially breaking functions like `permitAndDeposit()`, `deposit()`, or `mint()`.

## Impact
This vulnerability exposes the contract to a gas limit Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which could result in severe operational disruptions and financial losses for users. It may affect the availability of critical features, such as the token staking.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial to impose a maximum limit on the `rewardsTokens` array. Implementing a constant `MAX_LIMIT_LENGTH` will ensure that the number of reward tokens does not exceed a predefined threshold, preventing potential gas limit issues.
