# A malicious attacker can make significant amount of reward token to be locked in `StakedEXA` by calling `harvest()` frequently

## Summary
A large amount of reward Token(like `USDC/WBTC`) can be locked in `StakedEXA`. In the [StakedEXA.notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/3eb87e3edf3bcd57c4cc1c6a73e8255f575b76de/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L212-L217) function, `rewardData.rate` is calculated by dividing `amount`(or `amount + remainingRewards`) by  `rewardData.duration`, which is typically bigger than `7 * 86400`.  Whenever this function is called, the remainder of this division operation will be locked. Furthermore, as anybody can call this function many times, locked amount of  reward Token keeps growing and stakers can't receive expected rewards.  This is sever in the case of reward Tokens like `USDC/WBTC` whose decimal is low.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls the [harvest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/3eb87e3edf3bcd57c4cc1c6a73e8255f575b76de/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L344-L361) function, the [notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/3eb87e3edf3bcd57c4cc1c6a73e8255f575b76de/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L209-L229) function is called on L360.
Here, as Exactly Protocol currently provide markets for `USDC` and `WBTC`, providerAsset can be `USDC/WBTC`.
```solidity
File: contracts\StakedEXA.sol
344:   function harvest() public whenNotPaused { 
         [...]
360:     notifyRewardAmount(providerAsset, amount, address(this));
361:   }
```
In the [notifyRewardAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/3eb87e3edf3bcd57c4cc1c6a73e8255f575b76de/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L209-L229) function, there is a precision loss on L213 and L216.
`rewardData.rate` is calculated by dividing `amount`(or `amount + remainingRewards`) by  `rewardData.duration`, which is typically bigger than `7 * 86400`.  Whenever this function is called, the remainder of this `div` operation which is smaller than  `rewardsDuration`  is locked.
```solidity
File: contracts\StakedEXA.sol
209:   function notifyRewardAmount(IERC20 reward, uint256 amount, address notifier) internal onlyReward(reward) { 
         [...]
212:     if (block.timestamp >= rewardData.finishAt) {
213:       rewardData.rate = amount / rewardData.duration;
214:     } else {
215:       uint256 remainingRewards = (rewardData.finishAt - block.timestamp) * rewardData.rate;
216:       rewardData.rate = (amount + remainingRewards) / rewardData.duration;
217:     }
         [...]
229:   }
```
As anybody can call this function by calling the [StakedEXA.harvest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/3eb87e3edf3bcd57c4cc1c6a73e8255f575b76de/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L344-L361) function many times, locked amount of  reward Token keeps growing and stakers can't receive expected rewards.  This is sever in the case of reward Tokens like `USDC/WBTC` whose decimal is low.

## Impact
- Significant amount of reward tokens are locked in `StakedEXA`. This is sever when the decimals of reward Token is lower like `USDC/WBTC` whose decimal is `6/8`.
- Stakers can't receive their rewards correctly.

## Recommendation
Increase the precision of `rewardData.rate` by `1e18`.
