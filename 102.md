# Floating Pragma in StakedEXA.sol and Importing FixedPointMathLib.sol with Vulnerable Solidity Versions

## Summary
The StakedEXA.sol contract uses a floating pragma (^0.8.0) and imports FixedPointMathLib.sol, which may be compiled with Solidity versions 0.8.13 or 0.8.14. These specific versions have a known bug that affects inline assembly, potentially leading to incorrect behavior due to the Yul optimizer incorrectly removing memory writes.

## Vulnerability Detail
**Floating Pragma**

The `StakedEXA.sol` contract specifies a floating pragma:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

```
This allows the contract to be compiled with any Solidity compiler version from 0.8.0 to less than 0.9.0. While this provides flexibility, it also means that the contract could be compiled with versions 0.8.13 or 0.8.14, which have a known bug affecting inline assembly.

**Inline Assembly Bug in Solidity 0.8.13 and 0.8.14**
The bug, identified as SOL-2022-4, affects the Yul optimizer in Solidity versions 0.8.13 and 0.8.14. The optimizer may incorrectly remove memory writes from inline assembly blocks that do not access Solidity variables. This issue arises because the optimizer considers all memory writes in the outermost Yul block that are never read from as unused and removes them. This behavior is valid for the entire Yul program but problematic for inline assembly blocks optimized individually.
## Impact

The removal of memory writes can lead to incorrect behavior in the contract, as subsequent memory reads may not find the expected values.

## Code Snippet
The StakedEXA.sol contract imports FixedPointMathLib.sol, which uses inline assembly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Explicitly specify a Solidity compiler version of 0.8.15 or later in the pragma directive to avoid the bug
