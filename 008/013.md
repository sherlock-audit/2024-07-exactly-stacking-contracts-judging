# Precision loss when calculating rewardData.rate

### Summary

Precision loss when calculating rewardData.rate 

### Root Cause

In function below precision loss can occur:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L213
```solidity
  function notifyRewardAmount(IERC20 reward, uint256 amount, address notifier) internal onlyReward(reward) {
    updateIndex(reward);
    RewardData storage rewardData = rewards[reward];
    if (block.timestamp >= rewardData.finishAt) {
      rewardData.rate = amount / rewardData.duration;
    }
```
Let's suppose rewardData.duration is 1 week = 604800 seconds. When `notifyRewardAmount` is called If reward token is WBTC which has 8 decimals, up to 604799 / 1e8 WBTC can be lost (as if the amount was 604799 less). 604799 / 1e8 WBTC = 0.006 WBTC = 400 USD lost to precision loss. This 400 USD then cannot be distributed to stakers. 

### Internal pre-conditions

WBTC used

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

n/a

### Impact

Precision loss of 400 USDC

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Store the rewardRate scaled by 1e18, so loss of precision will be lower by magnitude of 1e18.
