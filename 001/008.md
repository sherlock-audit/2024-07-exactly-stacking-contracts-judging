# There is no mechanism to handle potential failures of the permit call gracefully, which could lead to issues with frontrunning attacks.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The [permitAndDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/3eb87e3edf3bcd57c4cc1c6a73e8255f575b76de/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L173-L176) function within the `StakedEXA` contract directly calls the permit method from the `ERC20PermitUpgradeable` interface without implementing any form of error handling or front-running protection mechanisms. Specifically, the function lacks a [try/catch](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20Permit:~:text=the%20use%20of%20try/catch%20allows%20the%20permit%20to%20fail%20and%20makes%20the%20code%20tolerant%20to%20frontrunning.) block around the permit call, which could lead to vulnerabilities if the permit operation fails due to reasons such as nonce mismatches or other errors. This omission exposes the contract to potential front-running attacks, where malicious actors could monitor pending transactions and attempt to manipulate the order of operations to their advantage.
```solidity
function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) {
    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
    return deposit(assets, receiver);
}
```
## Impact
If a permit operation fails due to a failed validation (e.g., nonce mismatch), the entire transaction will revert, potentially causing significant financial losses for the user who initiated the transaction. Additionally, the lack of front-running protection increases the risk of strategic attacks where an attacker observes a pending transaction and submits a similar transaction with a higher gas price to be mined first, potentially disrupting the intended execution flow of the original transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement a try/catch block around the permit call.
