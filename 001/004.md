# Only Permit Creator Can Execute permitAndDeposit

## Summary

The `permitAndDeposit` function in the `StakedEXA.sol` contract allows users to deposit assets using a permit signature. However, the function is restricted to be called only by the permit creator (msg.sender), preventing other contracts from executing the function on behalf of the signer.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `permitAndDeposit` function in `StakedEXA.sol` is designed to allow a user to deposit assets using a signed permit. Here is the relevant code [snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L173-L176):

```solidity
function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) {
    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
    return deposit(assets, receiver);
}
```

In this function, the permit function is called with `msg.sender` as the owner of the permit:

```solidity
IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
```

This setup ensures that only the permit creator (i.e., `msg.sender`) can call the `permitAndDeposit` function, thereby defeating the primary purpose of the permit, which is to allow someone to sign an approval signature so that another contract can execute functions on their behalf.

## Impact

This issue restricts the flexibility of the `permitAndDeposit` function, preventing other contracts or addresses from utilizing the signed permit to deposit assets on behalf of the signer. This limitation can be problematic in scenarios where third-party contracts or automated systems need to manage deposits for users.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) {
    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
    return deposit(assets, receiver);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To allow the permit to be used by other contracts or addresses, the function should verify that the `receiver` is the same as the address that signed the permit. This can be achieved by modifying the `permitAndDeposit` function to use `receiver` instead of `msg.sender`:

```solidity
function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) {
    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(receiver, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
    return deposit(assets, receiver);
}
```

By making this change, the `permitAndDeposit` function will correctly allow any contract or address to utilize the signed permit for depositing assets on behalf of the signer.
