# `permitAndDeposit` are allowed to be called by permit creator only

## Impact
`permitAndDeposit` are allowed to be called by permit creator only. No any other contracts will be able to execute these function on behalf of signer.

## Proof of Concept
`permitAndDeposit` function allows to provide signed permit in order to receive approve and deposit funds into the vault.

```solidity
File: StakedEXA.sol

  function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) {
    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
    return deposit(assets, receiver);
  }
```
This function calls `permit` and pass `msg.sender` as `_owner` to that function.
```solidity

function permit(
        address owner,
        address spender,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external;
```

**This means that signer can be only the same person that called `permitAndDeposit` function.**

However the purpose of permit is to allow someone to sign approve signature, so that this signature can be used by another contract to call some function on behalf of signer.

In this case, anyone should be able to sign permit for the vault, and vault should check that `_receiver` is same who signed permit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `receiver` instead of `msg.sender`.

```solidity
File: StakedEXA.sol

  function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) {
-    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
+    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(receiver, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
     return deposit(assets, receiver);
  }
```
