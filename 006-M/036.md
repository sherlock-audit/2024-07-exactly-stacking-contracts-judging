# Unclaimed Rewards Can Affect Reward Ratios Calculation

## Summary
There is an issue with the `StakedEXA.sol#notifyRewardAmount()` function, where unclaimed rewards may be incorrectly considered in the calculation of the reward amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `StakedEXA.sol#notifyRewardAmount()` function notifies the contract of a specified reward amount.

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(IERC20 reward, uint256 amount, address notifier) internal onlyReward(reward) {
    updateIndex(reward);
    RewardData storage rewardData = rewards[reward];
    if (block.timestamp >= rewardData.finishAt) {
        rewardData.rate = amount / rewardData.duration;
    } else {
        uint256 remainingRewards = (rewardData.finishAt - block.timestamp) * rewardData.rate;
        rewardData.rate = (amount + remainingRewards) / rewardData.duration;
    }

    if (rewardData.rate == 0) revert ZeroRate();
-->     if (
-->         rewardData.rate * rewardData.duration >
-->         reward.balanceOf(address(this)) - (address(reward) == asset() ? totalAssets() : 0)
-->     ) revert InsufficientBalance();

    rewardData.finishAt = uint40(block.timestamp) + rewardData.duration;
    rewardData.updatedAt = uint40(block.timestamp);

    emit RewardAmountNotified(reward, notifier, amount);
}
```

The provided code snippet includes a validation check to ensure the asset representing the reward amount has been transferred to the contract. However, if a user does not invoke the `claim_()/claimWithdraw()` function, their unclaimed rewards will remain with the contract. 
Notably, The code lines do not consider these unclaimed rewards, allowing an attacker to disproportionately inflate the reward rate without needing to transfer the corresponding assets to the contract.

Additionally, the [`notifyRewardAmount()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L453-L456) function can be invoked by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

Given the increasing frequency of private key exploits, if the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` key is compromised, an attacker could potentially freeze all assets in the protocol by repeatedly executing this vulnerability.

## Impact
All assets within the protocol could be permanently frozen.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enhance the validation process for reward amounts to appropriately account for unclaimed rewards.
