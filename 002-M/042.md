# Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability in `StakedEXA.sol#harvest()` Function

## Summary
The `StakedEXA.sol#setMarket()` function, if not properly approved for new markets, leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition in the `StakedEXA.sol#harvest()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setMarket()` function, which is constrained to the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, allows for the setting of a new market:

```solidity
function setMarket(Market market_) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    market = market_;
    emit MarketSet(market_, msg.sender);
}
```
However, there is a critical oversight: this function does not assign a `providerAsset` token for the new market. Consequently, when the `harvest()` function attempts to harvest the assets from the provider's market, it encounters issues:
```solidity
function harvest() public whenNotPaused {
    Market memMarket = market;
    address memProvider = provider;
    uint256 assets = Math.min(
        memMarket.convertToAssets(memMarket.allowance(memProvider, address(this))), 
        memMarket.maxWithdraw(memProvider)
    );
    uint256 amount = assets.mulWadDown(providerRatio);
    IERC20 providerAsset = IERC20(address(memMarket.asset()));
    uint256 duration = rewards[providerAsset].duration;
    if (duration == 0 || amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration) return;

    memMarket.withdraw(assets, address(this), memProvider);
    uint256 save = assets - amount;
-->    if (save != 0) memMarket.deposit(save, savings);

    notifyRewardAmount(providerAsset, amount, address(this));
}
```

At this line, any remaining assets are deposited back into `savings`. This action calls the `safeTransferFrom()` function from the inherited ERC4626, which will fail if the allowance for `market` has not been approved. Thus, the transaction will revert, creating a DoS scenario.

## Impact
This vulnerability prevents the protocol from harvesting new provider market assets as rewards, effectively hindering operations related to the new market.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is suggested to modify the `setMarket()` function to include the following code:

```solidity
function setMarket(Market market_) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    market = market_;

+++    IERC20 providerAsset = IERC20(address(memMarket.asset()));
+++   providerAsset.approve(address(market), type(uint256).max);

    emit MarketSet(market_, msg.sender);
}
```

This addition ensures that the necessary approval for the `providerAsset` is granted when a new market is set, thereby preventing any potential DoS in the harvesting process.
