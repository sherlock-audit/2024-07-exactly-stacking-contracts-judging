# Potential for Negative `saveAmount` Calculation

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `claimWithdraw` function, the calculation of `saveAmount` can result in a negative value under certain conditions. This occurs due to the way `saveAmount` is computed:
```solidity
uint256 saveAmount = rawEarned - claimableAmount - savedAmount;
```
Variables:
- `rawEarned`: Total rewards earned by the user.
- `claimableAmount`: The amount that can be claimed by the user.
- `savedAmount`: The amount that has been saved or reserved.
The potential for `saveAmount` to be negative arises when `savedAmount` is significantly larger than the combined value of `rawEarned` and `claimableAmount`. For example:
- `rawEarned`: 5000
- `claimableAmount`: 1000
- `savedAmount`: 4000
Calculation:

```solidity
uint256 saveAmount = rawEarned - claimableAmount - savedAmount;
// saveAmount = 5000 - 1000 - 4000
// saveAmount = -1000
```
In this case, `saveAmount` becomes `-1000`, which is negative.
## Impact
A negative `saveAmount` could lead to unintended consequences, such as improper accounting of rewards and potential errors in subsequent calculations or processes that depend on `saveAmount`. This could disrupt the overall reward distribution mechanism and cause issues in managing user balances and rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that `saveAmount` is capped at a minimum of zero. You can modify the calculation as follows:

```solidity
uint256 saveAmount = rawEarned > claimableAmount + savedAmount ? rawEarned - claimableAmount - savedAmount : 0;
```
