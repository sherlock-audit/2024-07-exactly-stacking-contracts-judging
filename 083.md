# The Market contract will have unlimited access to the StakedEXA contract's provider assets

### Summary

The StakedEXA contract's `initialize()` function approves the maximum possible amount (`type(uint256).max`) of the `providerAsset` for the market contract. This unlimited approval can pose significant security risks if the market contract is compromised or behaves maliciously.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the use of `type(uint256).max` as the approval amount in the `initialize()` function:

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The StakedEXA contract is deployed and initialized, granting unlimited approval to the market contract.
2. If the market contract is compromised (e.g., through a vulnerability or malicious upgrade):

- The attacker could drain all provider assets from the StakedEXA contract.
- The attacker could manipulate the market to perform unauthorized operations with the StakedEXA contract's assets.

3. Even if the market contract is not compromised, the unlimited approval remains a persistent risk for the lifetime of the contract.

### Impact

Potential loss of all provider assets held by the StakedEXA contract.
Unauthorized operations or transfers of assets.
Reduced trust in the protocol due to the persistent security risk.
Possible cascading effects on other parts of the system that depend on the StakedEXA contract's assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Instead of approving the maximum amount, approve only the necessary amount for each operation. This minimizes risks, reduce potential losses in case of a security breach and follows the principle of least privilege.
- Remove the unlimited approval from the initialize() function.
- Approve the specific amounts before each interaction with the market contract in the harvest() function: 

    uint256 currentAllowance = providerAsset.allowance(address(this), address(memMarket));
    if (currentAllowance < assets) {
        providerAsset.approve(address(memMarket), assets);
    }


2. If a larger approval is needed for gas efficiency:

- Approve a reasonable upper limit based on expected usage, not the maximum possible value.
- Implement a function to adjust the approved amount as needed, with proper access controls.
