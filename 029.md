# Reward rate rounding error will cause significant loss of funds for all users

### Summary

`StakedEXA::notifyRewardAmount()` calculates the reward rate by dividing the amount of rewards by the duration. Some tokens such as USDC, which is in scope as stated by the sponsor, only have 6 decimals, which means it is very easy for rounding errors to cause significant loss of funds. Additionally, rewards are notified by providers which may distribute rewards as they please, which means that they may choose a distribution over time, possibly hourly or daily, which will trigger the rounding error a lot of times, causing very significant losses.

### Root Cause

In `StakedEXA.sol::213` and `StakedEXA.sol::216`, the reward rate as `amount / rewardData.duration;` or `(amount + remainingRewards) / rewardData.duration` if there are rewards left. As it does not multiply by any factor before dividing, it will incur rounding errors, which means rewards will be forever lost. The vulnerable code is [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L212-L217).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Rounding error due to the added rewards. This is the expected scenario due to the automatic `StakedEXA::harvest()` functionality by the provider.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. `StakedEXA::notifyRewardAmount()` is called with an amount that triggers a rounding error. It may be called by harvesting or the admin manually.

### Impact

The duration is `24 weeks` in the tests, which is `14.515200e6` tokens. Thus, up to â‰ƒ `14.5e6` tokens may be lost due to rounding errors each time rewards are added. As the providers may notify rewards as they place, if they choose for example 1000 rewards a day and the rounding error is triggered every time, it would be a loss of `14.5/1000 = 1.45 %`, a very significative amount. If we assume the rounding error is somewhere in the middle from 0 to 14.5, 7.25, the average error would still be 0.75% which is still a significant amount.

### PoC

Add the following test to `StakedEXA.t.sol` confirming that up to `14.5` usd may be lost.
```solidity
function test_POC_notifyRewardAmount_roundingError() external {
  MockERC20 rC = new MockERC20("reward C", "rC", 6);
  vm.label(address(rC), "rC");

  stEXA.enableReward(rC);
  stEXA.setRewardsDuration(rC, duration);

  uint256 amount = 2*duration - 1;
  rC.mint(address(stEXA), amount);
  stEXA.notifyRewardAmount(rC, amount);

  (,,,, uint256 rate) = stEXA.rewards(rC);
  assertEq(duration, 14.515200e6); // 14.5 tokens lost
  assertEq(rate, 1); // 1 x duration = duration, so duration rewards were lost.
}
```

### Mitigation

Multiply the reward rate by `1e18` before diving by the duration to mitigate rounding errors and prevent loss of funds.
