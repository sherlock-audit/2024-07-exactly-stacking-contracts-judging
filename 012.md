# Inconsistent Reward Updates Due to Concurrent Modification

## Summary
In the `claim_` function, there is an issue with how the reward amounts are updated. The function performs operations on the `saved` mapping, which keeps track of the amount of rewards claimed by each user. The problematic logic occurs when the `savedAmount` variable is updated.

Consider the following code snippet:
```solidity
uint256 savedAmount = saved[msg.sender][reward];
if (someCondition) {
    saved[msg.sender][reward] = savedAmount + saveAmount;
}
```
This code snippet performs the following steps:

- It retrieves the current reward amount for `msg.sender` and `reward`, storing it in the `savedAmount` variable.
- It then updates the `saved` mapping by adding `saveAmount` to `savedAmount`.

However, this update is flawed. The line:
```solidity
saved[msg.sender][reward] = savedAmount + saveAmount;
```
can be expanded to:

```solidity
saved[msg.sender][reward] = saved[msg.sender][reward] + saveAmount;
```
Here, the issue lies in the potential concurrency problem. If multiple transactions modify the same reward for `msg.sender` simultaneously, they may read and write to the `saved` mapping at the same time, leading to inconsistent or incorrect reward values.
## Vulnerability Detail
The real problem comes into play if there are multiple calls or updates that could lead to discrepancies. For example:
```solidity
uint256 savedAmount = saved[msg.sender][reward]; // Suppose saved[msg.sender][reward] is 10
// At this point, savedAmount = 10

// An additional amount to be saved
uint256 saveAmount = 8;

// Update the saved amount
saved[msg.sender][reward] = savedAmount + saveAmount;
```
This expands to:

```solidity
saved[msg.sender][reward] = 10 + 8; // Result: saved[msg.sender][reward] = 18
```
The issue arises if `savedAmount` was mistakenly or intentionally not retrieved correctly, or if there are concurrency issues where multiple updates occur simultaneously. This could lead to race conditions where the final saved amount is not as expected.

Consider the following scenario where two separate transactions update the saved amount concurrently:

- Transaction A retrieves `savedAmount` as 10 and plans to add 5, so it sets `saved[msg.sender][reward]` to 15.
- Transaction B also retrieves `savedAmount` as 10 (before Transaction A's update is processed) and plans to add 8, so it sets `saved[msg.sender][reward]` to 18.

In this case, the final saved amount could end up being inconsistent or incorrect due to overlapping updates:
- Expected Amount: 10 (original) + 5 (Transaction A) + 8 (Transaction B) = 23
- Actual Amount After Concurrent Updates: It could be either 15 or 18, but not 23, due to the race condition.

## Impact
Incorrect Reward Distribution: Users might end up with incorrect amounts of rewards, which can be either over-credited or under-credited based on the timing of updates.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 The function should be designed to ensure atomic updates and handle concurrency. One approach is to use proper synchronization mechanisms or checks to ensure that updates are consistently applied.
