# Non-Compliance with ERC-20 Standard Due to Reverting on Zero-Value Transfers

## Summary
The README states StakedEXA follows a strict ERC-20 compliance. However, the _update function(which is called before any stEXA transfer is made) reverts on zero transfers, which violates the ERC-20 standard that states transfers of zero values must be treated as normal transfers and must fire the Transfer event.

> Note Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event.



## Vulnerability Detail
The _update function in the StakedEXA contract includes a check that reverts the transaction if the transfer amount is zero. This behavior is non-compliant with the ERC-20 standard, which explicitly requires that transfers of zero values be treated as normal transfers and that the Transfer event be emitted.

## Impact
This non-compliance with the ERC-20 standard can lead to unexpected behavior for users and integrators who expect the contract to handle zero-value transfers correctly.

> The protocol team can use the README (and only the README) to define language that indicates the codebase's restrictions and/or expected functionality. Issues that break these statements, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity

## Recommendation
To ensure ERC-20 compliance, modify the _update function to handle zero-value transfers as normal transfers and emit the Transfer event accordingly.
