# ERC20 non-compliance: StakedEXA cannot be transferred.

### Summary

It can't


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L129
```solidity
function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override whenNotPaused {
    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (from == address(0)) {
      ...
    } else if (to == address(0)) {
      ..
    } else revert Untransferable();
```
ERC20.transfer() will call _update and if the from and to is not address(0) then the function reverts.
