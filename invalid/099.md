# No Storage Gap implemented for Upgradeable Contracts in StakedEXA.sol and Market.sol

## Summary
The `StakedEXA.sol` and `Market.sol` contracts are upgradeable but do not implement the `__gap` array pattern to reserve storage slots for future variables. This omission can lead to storage collisions and unexpected behavior during future upgrades, especially since StakedEXA.sol imports Market.sol.

## Vulnerability Detail
In upgradeable smart contracts, maintaining a consistent storage layout across contract upgrades is crucial. The `__gap` array is a common pattern used to reserve storage slots for future variables. Without this array, adding new state variables in future upgrades can overwrite existing storage slots, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

The `StakedEXA.sol` contract inherits from several OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts and imports `Market.sol`. Neither of these contracts includes a `__gap` array to reserve storage slots for future variables. This omission increases the risk of storage collisions, particularly if new variables are added to `Market.sol` in future upgrades, which could directly impact the storage layout of `StakedEXA.sol`.

## Impact
Adding new state variables in future upgrades can overwrite existing storage slots, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Implement __gap arrays in both StakedEXA.sol and Market.sol to reserve storage slots for future variables. This will help maintain a consistent storage layout across upgrades and prevent storage collisions.
