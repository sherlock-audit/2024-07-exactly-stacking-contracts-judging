# Slippage Handling in permitAndDeposit Function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `permitAndDeposit` function in the `StakedEXA.sol` contract does not handle potential slippage or unexpected deposit limits. This can lead to situations where the user does not receive the expected amount of shares due to slippage loss. This issue is particularly relevant for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) that do not have the ability to revert transactions if the exact output amount is not achieved.

**Relevant EIP-4626 Security Consideration:**

According to the EIP-4626 security considerations, if implementors intend to support EOA account access directly, they should consider adding additional function calls for deposit/mint/withdraw/redeem with the means to accommodate slippage loss or unexpected deposit/withdrawal limits, since EOAs have no other means to revert the transaction if the exact output amount is not achieved.

## Impact
Users may not receive the expected amount of shares due to slippage, as anyone can front-run and deposit tokens, which will result in fewer shares for the user.

```solidity
function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) {
    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
    return deposit(assets, receiver);
}

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p, uint256 minShares) external returns (uint256) {
    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
    uint256 shares = deposit(assets, receiver);
    require(shares >= minShares, "Slippage too high");
    return shares;
}
```
