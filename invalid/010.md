# If `excessFactor` is set to `1e18`, the discount factor will be `1e18`, which means intended penalty for exceeding `refTime` is not enforced

## Summary
The `discountFactor` function's behavior with `excessFactor` set to `1e18` can indeed lead to a scenario where no penalty is applied, which may be unintended. Here's a breakdown of how this plays out:
## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assignment and Subtraction:
```solidity
uint256 memExcessFactor = excessFactor;
return (1e18 - memExcessFactor).mulWadDown((memRefTime * 1e18) / time) + memExcessFactor;
```
If `excessFactor` is `1e18`, then:
```solidity
uint256 memExcessFactor = 1e18;
uint256 difference = 1e18 - memExcessFactor; // This results in 0
```
The `difference` is zero, so:
```solidity
return 0.mulWadDown((memRefTime * 1e18) / time) + memExcessFactor;
```
Since `0.mulWadDown(...)` is 0, the function effectively returns:
```solidity
return memExcessFactor; // Which is 1e18
```
2. Implication:
The discount factor is `1e18`, which means no discount is applied, effectively making the penalty factor irrelevant. This could be a significant issue since the intent was to apply a penalty or discount based on the comparison between `time` and `refTime`.

Now, what makes the situation where `excessFactor` is equivalent to `1e18` particularly noteworthy in the `initialize` function of the `StakedEXA` contract is the absence of a condition that explicitly checks for equality with `1e18`, focusing solely on values strictly greater than `1e18`. This oversight allows for a scenario where `excessFactor` can be set exactly to `1e18` without triggering a revert, unlike the checks for `p.refTime == 0`, `p.refTime <= p.minTime`, or `p.excessFactor > 1e18`, which are designed to prevent initialization under certain conditions deemed invalid. Specifically, the condition in the initialize function is as follows:

```solidity
if (p.refTime == 0 || p.refTime <= p.minTime || p.excessFactor > 1e18) revert InvalidRange();
```
This line ensures that the contract does not initialize if `refTime` is zero, less than or equal to `minTime`, or if `excessFactor` exceeds `1e18`, but it does not account for the scenario where `excessFactor` equals `1e18`, potentially altering the intended economic penalties for staking durations beyond the optimal `refTime`.
## Impact
When `excessFactor` equals `1e18`, the `discountFactor` function fails to apply any discount, leading to a potential zero discount being applied regardless of the actual `refTime`. This can result in the contract not functioning as intended, possibly allowing users to bypass penalties or discounts that were meant to be enforced based on the time reference, ultimately affecting the fairness and economic model of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `initialize` function, the check should be:
```solidity
if (p.refTime == 0 || p.refTime <= p.minTime || p.excessFactor >= 1e18) revert InvalidRange();
```
The critical aspect here is that the `initialize` function includes a check that ensures `excessFactor` is strictly less than `1e18`. By using `>= 1e18` rather than `> 1e18`, the function correctly prevents the contract from initializing with an `excessFactor` that could lead to the issue described. This constraint ensures that `excessFactor` is always within a valid range, thus avoiding scenarios where the discount factor calculation might fail to apply the intended adjustments or penalties.
