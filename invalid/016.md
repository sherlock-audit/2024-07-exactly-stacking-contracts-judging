# Incorrect Asset Seizure Calculation Due to Decimal Mismatch in Liquidations

## Summary
The calculateSeize function in the Auditor contract contains a critical vulnerability where it fails to correctly account for different decimal places between the repay market and the seize market. This can lead to significant miscalculations in liquidations, potentially resulting in over-seizure or under-seizure of assets.
## Vulnerability Detail
The calculateSeize function calculates the baseAmount using the actualRepayAssets and the price of the borrowed asset, scaled to the decimals of the repay market:
```solidity
uint256 baseAmount = actualRepayAssets.mulDivUp(priceBorrowed, 10 ** markets[repayMarket].decimals);
```
When calculating the seizeAssets, the function scales the baseAmount to the decimals of the seize market using the price of the collateral asset:
```solidity
seizeAssets = Math.min(
  baseAmount.mulDivUp(10 ** markets[seizeMarket].decimals, priceCollateral).mulWadUp(
    1e18 + memIncentive.liquidator + memIncentive.lenders
  ),
  seizeMarket.maxWithdraw(borrower)
);
```
## Impact
Over-seizure of assets: Liquidators may receive more collateral than they should, unfairly penalizing borrowers.
Under-seizure of assets: Liquidators may receive less collateral than they should, potentially leaving the protocol with bad debt.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 /// @notice Calculates the amount of collateral to be seized when a position is undercollateralized.
  /// @param repayMarket market from where the debt will be repaid.
  /// @param seizeMarket market from where the assets will be seized by the liquidator.
  /// @param borrower account in which assets are being seized.
  /// @param actualRepayAssets amount being repaid.
  /// @return lendersAssets amount to be added for other lenders as a compensation of bad debt clearing.
  /// @return seizeAssets amount that can be seized by the liquidator.
  function calculateSeize(
    Market repayMarket,
    Market seizeMarket,
    address borrower,
    uint256 actualRepayAssets
  ) external view returns (uint256 lendersAssets, uint256 seizeAssets) {
    LiquidationIncentive memory memIncentive = liquidationIncentive;
    lendersAssets = actualRepayAssets.mulWadDown(memIncentive.lenders);

    // read prices for borrowed and collateral markets
    uint256 priceBorrowed = assetPrice(markets[repayMarket].priceFeed);
    uint256 priceCollateral = assetPrice(markets[seizeMarket].priceFeed);
    uint256 baseAmount = actualRepayAssets.mulDivUp(priceBorrowed, 10 ** markets[repayMarket].decimals);

    seizeAssets = Math.min(
      baseAmount.mulDivUp(10 ** markets[seizeMarket].decimals, priceCollateral).mulWadUp(
        1e18 + memIncentive.liquidator + memIncentive.lenders
      ),
      seizeMarket.maxWithdraw(borrower)
    );
  }

   function testexploit() external {
    uint256 expectedSeize; uint256 actualSeize;
        uint256 actualRepayAssets = 1000000; // 1 USDC (6 decimals)

        // Expected calculation (assuming 1:1 price ratio for simplicity):
        // 1 USDC should seize 1 ETH
        expectedSeize = 1 ether; // 1 ETH (18 decimals)

        (, actualSeize) = auditor.calculateSeize(markets[0], markets[1], BOB, actualRepayAssets);

        // actualSeize will be 1e30 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) instead of 1e18
        // This is 1 billion times more than expected!
        assert(actualSeize == 1e30);
        assert(actualSeize != expectedSeize);
    }
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement proper decimal normalization in the calculateSeize function:

```solidity

function calculateSeize(
  Market repayMarket,
  Market seizeMarket,
  address borrower,
  uint256 actualRepayAssets
) external view returns (uint256 lendersAssets, uint256 seizeAssets) {
  LiquidationIncentive memory memIncentive = liquidationIncentive;
  lendersAssets = actualRepayAssets.mulWadDown(memIncentive.lenders);

  uint256 priceBorrowed = assetPrice(markets[repayMarket].priceFeed);
  uint256 priceCollateral = assetPrice(markets[seizeMarket].priceFeed);
  
  // Normalize to 18 decimals
  uint256 normalizedRepayAssets = actualRepayAssets * 10 ** (18 - markets[repayMarket].decimals);
  uint256 baseAmount = normalizedRepayAssets.mulWadUp(priceBorrowed);

  uint256 seizeAssets18 = baseAmount.divWadUp(priceCollateral).mulWadUp(
    1e18 + memIncentive.liquidator + memIncentive.lenders
  );

  // Convert back to seizeMarket decimals
  seizeAssets = seizeAssets18 / 10 ** (18 - markets[seizeMarket].decimals);

  seizeAssets = Math.min(seizeAssets, seizeMarket.maxWithdraw(borrower));
}
```
