# Use of deprecated Chainlink function latestAnswer

## Summary
Use of deprecated Chainlink function latestAnswer
## Vulnerability Detail
contract uses Chainlink's deprecated latestAnswer function, this function also does not guarantee that the price returned by the Chainlink price feed is not stale and there is no additional checks to ensure that the return values are valid.
## Impact
According to Chainlink's documentation, the latestAnswer function is deprecated. 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function assetPrice(IPriceFeed priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (address(priceFeed) == BASE_FEED) return basePrice;

    int256 price = priceFeed.latestAnswer(); //@audit last answer is dup
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    return uint256(price) * baseFactor;
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The latestRoundData function should be used instead of the deprecated latestAnswer function and add sufficient checks to ensure that the pricefeed is not stale.
