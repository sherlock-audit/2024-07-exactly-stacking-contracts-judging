# In `_update` function `avgStart[to]` i.e `uint256 time` is updated to a monetary value.

## Summary
`avgStart[to]` is updated to monetary value in `_update` function

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
      if (time > memRefTime) avgStart[to] = block.timestamp * 1e18;
      else {
        uint256 numerator = start * balance + block.timestamp * 1e18 * amount;
        avgStart[to] = numerator == 0 ? 0 : (numerator - 1) / total + 1;
      }
```
In the above part of `_update` function, if the `else` block is executed and `numerator` !=0 then, ` avgStart[to]` is set to `(numerator - 1) / total + 1` , which by the code we can understand is a monetary value. 

```solidity
/// @notice Average starting time with the tokens staked per account.
mapping(address account => uint256 time) public avgStart;
```
But `avgStart` is a mapping and `avgStart[to]` refers to `uint256 time` and as per the comment above we can understand it's usage.

Although both values are `uint256` hence it doesn't give syntactical error. But if the mapping or function is used somewhere else , it can give wrong value.


## Impact

If the mapping or function is used somewhere else , it can give wrong value.

## Recommendation
Use appropriate variable to assign the `(numerator - 1) / total + 1` ratio.
