# use address(this) in place of "this"

## Summary
use address this in place of this.
## Vulnerability Detail
function enableMarket(
    Market market,
    IPriceFeed priceFeed,
    uint128 adjustFactor
  ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
 @>   if (market.auditor() != this) revert AuditorMismatch();


 function borrow(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address borrower
  ) external whenNotPaused whenNotFrozen returns (uint256 borrowShares) {
    if (assets == 0) revert ZeroBorrow();
    spendAllowance(borrower, assets);

    RewardsController memRewardsController = rewardsController;
    if (address(memRewardsController) != address(0)) memRewardsController.handleBorrow(borrower);

    depositToTreasury(updateFloatingDebt());

    borrowShares = previewBorrow(assets);

    uint256 newFloatingDebt = floatingDebt + assets;
    floatingDebt = newFloatingDebt;
    // check if the underlying liquidity that the account wants to withdraw is borrowed, also considering the reserves
    if (floatingBackupBorrowed + newFloatingDebt > floatingAssets.mulWadDown(1e18 - reserveFactor)) {
      revert InsufficientProtocolLiquidity();
    }

    totalFloatingBorrowShares += borrowShares;
    accounts[borrower].floatingBorrowShares += borrowShares;

    emit Borrow(msg.sender, receiver, borrower, assets, borrowShares);
    emitMarketUpdate();

  @>  auditor.checkBorrow(this, borrower);
