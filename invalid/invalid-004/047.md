# Withdrawals will be DoSed due to not using `SafeERC20` as some ERC20 tokens do not return a bool

### Summary

In `reward.transfer()` is used in `StakedEXA::claimWithdraw()`, which is called when withdrawing, which calls `StakedEXA::_update()` with `to == address(0)`. This will revert for tokens that do not return a bool on transfer and the protocol is likely to interact with these tokens and it is a clear mistake because the protocol imports the `SafeERC20` but does not actually use it when transferring tokens.

### Root Cause

In [`StakedEXA.sol::195`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L195) and [`StakedEXA.sol::202`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L202), `StakedEXA::claimWithdraw()`, which is called when withdrawing via `StakedEXA::_update()` having `to == address(0)`, `IERC20.transfer()` is used instead of `SafeERC20.safeTransfer()`, making it revert for some tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

1. Token does not return a bool on transfer.

### Attack Path

1. Deposit to `StakedEXA`.
2. Withdraw from `StakedEXA` which fails due to the token not returning a bool on `.transfer()`.

### Impact

Stuck funds in `StakedEXA.sol`.

### PoC

This is a common bug in smart contracts and there is no significant complexity involved, no POC is needed.
The required proof is that `StakedEXA` imports `SafeERC20` but does not actually use it.

### Mitigation

Use `reward.safeTransfer()` instead.
