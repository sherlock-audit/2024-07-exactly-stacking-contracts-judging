# Non-compliance with EIP-4626 Security Considerations

## Summary
see below
## Vulnerability Detail
The provided contract, `StakedEXA`, aims to facilitate staking and reward mechanisms for its users. However, it exhibits non-compliance with certain aspects of EIP-4626, specifically regarding the withdrawal and deposit functionalities, as well as the calculation of total assets.
1. Withdraw Function Non-compliance:
- The [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L356) function is responsible for claiming rewards and performing [withdrawals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L738). However, it does not explicitly emit a Withdraw event upon successful withdrawal operations. This omission prevents users from easily tracking withdrawal activities on the blockchain, which is crucial for transparency and auditability purposes.
- Additionally, there is no explicit check within [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L356) to ensure that all assets intended for  [withdrawals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L738) can indeed be withdrawn successfully. In scenarios where the contract does not hold enough assets or encounters other issues preventing withdrawal, the function should revert to prevent potential loss of funds or incorrect state transitions.
2. Deposit Function Non-compliance:
- While the [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L358) there is no explicit check to ensure that all assets intended for deposit can actually be deposited. This could lead to situations where users believe they have [deposited](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L253) more assets than what was actually processed, leading to discrepancies in expected vs. actual balances.
3. Total Assets Calculation Non-compliance:
- The [totalAssets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/StakedEXA.sol#L524-L526) function simply returns the total supply of the token (`totalSupply()`), which does not account for any fees charged against assets in the vault. According to EIP-4626, the `totalAssets` function must include any fees that are charged against assets in the vault. This discrepancy means the contract does not accurately reflect the total value of assets managed by the contract, potentially misleading users about the health and status of the contract.

## Impact
The primary impact of these non-compliances is the potential for decreased trust and confidence in the contract's functionality and integrity. Users may face difficulties in accurately tracking their investments and rewards, and the contract may not accurately represent the total value of assets it manages. This could lead to financial losses or incorrect perceptions of the contract's performance.
