# The function baseRate will result in error if the x > EXP_TRESHOLD

### Summary

If the calculation of x ends up to be above the EXP_TRESHOLD, the sigmoid will be 0. In the calculation of x in the next step, we can see that if sigmoid = 0, sigmoid.mulWadDown(uGlobal)).toInt256().lnWad() will cause the function to try to calculate ln(0), which is undefined and the function will cause the transaction to revert.

### Root Cause

In InterestRateModel.sol:153 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-exactly-stacking-contracts/blob/main/protocol/contracts/InterestRateModel.sol#L153-L155 if the x if above the EXP_TRESHOLD, the sigmoid is 0 and the ln(0) finally will revert the transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

First use case
1. sigmoidSpeed needs to be a positive value, and the auxSigmoid needs to be large
2. uGlobal is a value close to 1e18
The term int256(uGlobal.divWadDown(1e18 - uGlobal)).lnWad() - auxSigmoid must be sufficiently negative - this can happen if uGlobal is close to 1e18, making uGlobal.divWadDown(1e18 - uGlobal) very large, and thus, logarithm positive and then subtracting a large auxSigmoid can make the term negative and the x greater than EXP_TRESHOLD

Second use case
1. uGlobal much smaller than 1e18
2. negative sigmoidSpeed and small auxSigmoid
The term int256(uGlobal.divWadDown(1e18 - uGlobal)).lnWad() - auxSigmoid must be sufficiently positive - this can happen if uGlobal is much smaller than 1e18, making uGlobal.divWadDown(1e18 - uGlobal) small, and thus, logarithm negative and then subtracting a small auxSigmoid can make the term positive and the x greater than EXP_TRESHOLD
