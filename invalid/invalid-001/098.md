# Any call to permit is front runnable, which will cause a DoS

## Summary
Unwrapped permit call can be front run by attackers causing a DoS attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
[Here](https://www.trust-security.xyz/post/permission-denied) is a very popular article about this vulnerability. 
Let's take a look at `permitAndDeposit` function in `StakedEXA` contract.
```solidity
function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) { 
    IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
    return deposit(assets, receiver);
  }
```
As you can see in above code, deposit is performed after permit . If permit reverts, deposit cannot be called, causing a DoS attack.
To DoS someone calling any of the functions that use permit inside `StakedEXA` is very easy, the attacker front runs the tx and call permit directly with the same parameters. Now the victim's tx will revert, since you can't permit twice with the same parameters and same nonce.

## Impact
An attacker can DoS any tx that uses permit to DoS users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Wrap the permit in a try/catch. The linked article recommends the same.
```solidity
function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) { 
    try IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s) {
        deposit(assets, receiver);
        return;
    } catch {
        if (IERC20(token).allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) > = p.value) {
             deposit(assets, receiver);
             return;
        }
    }

    revert("Permit Failure");
 }
```
