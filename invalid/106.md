# Inaccessible vault share After Changing Savings Address

## Summary
The contract allows for the change of the savings address, but tokens saved in the previous savings address remain inaccessible to the new savings address

## Vulnerability Detail
When the savings address is updated to a new address, the tokens and shares allocated to the previous savings address are not transferred to the new address. This means that any rewards or assets saved in the old address remain there and cannot be accessed by the new savings address. The contract does not include logic to transfer these assets automatically upon changing the savings address.

## Impact
The new savings address cannot access or manage the tokens saved in the previous savings address

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Transfer shares from old address balance to new savings address
```
function setSavings(address savings_) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
  if (savings_ == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
  
  // Transfer tokens from the old savings address to the new savings address
  uint256 savingAmount = balanceOf(savings);
  _balances[savings] = 0;
  _balances[savings_] += savingAmount;
  
  // Update the savings address
  savings = savings_;
  
  emit SavingsSet(savings_, msg.sender);
}
```
