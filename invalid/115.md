# `Market` and `StakedEXA` are non-compliant with ERC4626 standard

## Summary
Incomplete implementation of ERC4626 standard.
## Vulnerability Detail
As per EIP-4626, the `maxDeposit` and the `maxMint` methods "MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if deposits are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.". This is not the case currently, as even if contracts (`Market` and `StakedEXA`) are paused, those method will still return what it usually does. 
## Impact
Not expected functionality and compliance with ERC4626 standard. Integrations might suffer from differences.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Override `maxDeposit` and `maxMint` methods so they can handle the situation in which contracts are paused.
