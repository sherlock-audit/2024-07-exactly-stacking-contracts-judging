# The calculations of assetsOwed, assetsDiscounted, trasuryFee, floatingAssets and floatingDebt may be incorrect because they think the year has 365 days

### Summary

While 3/4 years have 365 days per each, each 4rth year has 366 days.

Some calculations among the Exactly protocol's code, such as the `Market` and the `InterestRateModel` use the equivalent value of `365 days`, while in some years (such as in the current year **2024**), there're 366 days.

### Internal pre-conditions

This problem occurs when the current year is divisible by 4 without remainders, such as `2024 % 4 = 0`.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The problem lies in the calculation itself.

### Impact

The calculations on leap years will be higher (favoring the greater final value) by `0.273224044 %`.

### PoC

None.
