# `permitAndDeposit` doesn’t work with DAI

## Proof of Concept
The function `permitAndDeposit` in the `StakedEXA.sol` contract permits a spender and deposits assets in a single transaction.
```solidity
File: StakedEXA.sol

     function permitAndDeposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, Permit calldata p) external returns (uint256) {
       IERC20Permit(asset()).permit(msg.sender, address(this), p.value, p.deadline, p.v, p.r, p.s);
       return deposit(assets, receiver);
     }
```
The issue is that the test suite shows that the protocol aims to use DAI tokens but the DAI token’s permit signature is different. 

From the contract at address `0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F` ([link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F#code#L171)), we see the `permit` function:
```solidity
     function permit(address holder, address spender, uint256 nonce, uint256 expiry,
                    bool allowed, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external
```
Due to the missing `nonce` field, DAI, a token which allows permit based interactions, cannot be used with signed messages for depositing into associated DAI vaults. Due to the wrong parameters, the permit transactions will revert.

## Impact
It is evident from the code that the permit function call does not match the signature of DAI’s permit function.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
For the special case of DAI token, allow a different implementation of the permit function which allows a nonce variable.
