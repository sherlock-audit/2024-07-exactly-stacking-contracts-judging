# An attacker will be unable to correctly execute the harvest, resulting in potential reward distribution issues for stakers.

### Summary

The improper comparison between amount (uint256) and duration (uint40) will cause potential malfunction in reward distribution for stakers as the contract will prematurely exit the harvest function. The root cause is in the harvest function where amount is compared to duration.

### Root Cause

In StakedEXA.sol:354, the comparison of amount (assets) < duration (rewards duration) is logically incorrect.

```sol
  function harvest() public whenNotPaused {
    Market memMarket = market;
    address memProvider = provider;
    uint256 assets = Math.min(
      memMarket.convertToAssets(memMarket.allowance(memProvider, address(this))),
      memMarket.maxWithdraw(memProvider)
    );
    uint256 amount = assets.mulWadDown(providerRatio);
    IERC20 providerAsset = IERC20(address(memMarket.asset()));
    uint256 duration = rewards[providerAsset].duration;
>    if (duration == 0 || amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration) return;

    memMarket.withdraw(assets, address(this), memProvider);
    uint256 save = assets - amount;
    if (save != 0) memMarket.deposit(save, savings);

    notifyRewardAmount(providerAsset, amount, address(this));
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The rewards duration must be non-zero for comparisons to bypass the zero check and reach the invalid comparison logic.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker might attempt to exploit by executing harvest() during invalid conditions.
2. The harvest() function will exit prematurely if amount < duration due to the erroneous check.

### Impact

Since amount represents the number of tokens and duration represents time, the function may exit erroneously even during valid conditions, preventing proper distribution of rewards. The stakers suffer potential delays or failures in receiving their due rewards, creating inefficiencies in the reward system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure proper threshold comparison using a practical minimum reward amount instead of comparing amount and duration directly. Introduce a constant MIN_REWARD_AMOUNT to replace the invalid comparison.
