# Early Return in Harvest Function Prevents Reward Distribution

## Summary
The harvest function always returns early due to the condition amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration, preventing reward distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
The harvest function includes a condition that checks if the amount of rewards is less than the duration:
```solidity
if (duration == 0 || amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration) return;
```
If this condition is always true, the function will return early and not proceed with the reward distribution, making the harvest function ineffective
## Impact
The harvest function will never distribute rewards, leading to stakers not receiving their earned rewards and potentially disrupting the incentive mechanism of the staking contract.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function harvest() public whenNotPaused {
    Market memMarket = market;
    address memProvider = provider;
    uint256 assets = Math.min(
        memMarket.convertToAssets(memMarket.allowance(memProvider, address(this))),
        memMarket.maxWithdraw(memProvider)
    );
    uint256 amount = assets.mulWadDown(providerRatio);
    IERC20 providerAsset = IERC20(address(memMarket.asset()));
    uint256 duration = rewards[providerAsset].duration;
    if (duration == 0 || amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration) return;

    memMarket.withdraw(
```
