# In StakedEXA.sol's _update, parameter validation condition is wrong.

## Summary
The `_update` function is checking the validity of the input parameters `from` and `to`, but the check conditions are incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail
At the `_update` function's check logic is following

    @here >>> if (from == address(0)) {
      ...
    @here >>> } else if (to == address(0)) {
      ...
    @here >>> } else revert Untransferable();

    super._update(from, to, amount);

In `if (from == address(0)) {` clause, `to` must be valid address because of code's logic,
Also in `else if (to == address(0)) {` clause, `from` must be valid address because of code's logic,
Additionally, `else` clause have to be called when `from` and `to` is valid, so revert transfer action.

Perhaps the developer thought wrong when calculating the conditions.ðŸ˜Š

## Impact
In the case of the current code, if from and to are valid, revert is unconditionally called, resulting in serious results in which all logic is not executed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have to change the if condition logic as following;

    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override whenNotPaused {
      if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
      - if (from == address(0)) {
      + if (from == address(0) && to != address(0)) {
      uint256 start = avgStart[to];
      uint256 time = start != 0 ? block.timestamp * 1e18 - start : 0;
      uint256 memRefTime = refTime * 1e18;
      uint256 balance = balanceOf(to);
      uint256 total = amount + balance;

      for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardsTokens.length; ++i) {
        IERC20 reward = rewardsTokens[i];
        updateIndex(reward);

        if (time > memRefTime) {
          if (balance != 0) claimWithdraw(reward, to, balance);
          avgIndexes[to][reward] = rewards[reward].index;
        } else {
          if (balance != 0) claim_(reward);
          uint256 numerator = avgIndexes[to][reward] * balance + rewards[reward].index * amount;
          avgIndexes[to][reward] = numerator == 0 ? 0 : (numerator - 1) / total + 1;
        }
      }
      if (time > memRefTime) avgStart[to] = block.timestamp * 1e18;
      else {
        uint256 numerator = start * balance + block.timestamp * 1e18 * amount;
        avgStart[to] = numerator == 0 ? 0 : (numerator - 1) / total + 1;
      }
      harvest();
    - } else if (to == address(0)) {
    + } else if (to == address(0) && from != address(0)) {
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardsTokens.length; ++i) {
        IERC20 reward = rewardsTokens[i];
        updateIndex(reward);
        claimWithdraw(reward, from, amount);
      }
    - } else revert Untransferable();
    + } else if (from == address(0) && to == address(0)) revert Untransferable();

    super._update(from, to, amount);
  }
