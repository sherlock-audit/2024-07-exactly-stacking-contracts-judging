# The `StakedEXA.sol#harvest()` function can be DoSed.

## Summary
If a new market is set because the allowance for `market` is not approved in the `StakedEXA.sol#setMarket()` function, a Denial of Service occurs in the `StakedEXA.sol#harvest()` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` sets a new market using the `StakedEXA.sol#setMarket()` function.
```solidity
  function setMarket(Market market_) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    market = market_;
    emit MarketSet(market_, msg.sender);
  }
```
The problem is that this function does not assign a `providerAsset` token for the new market.

On the other hand, the 'StakedEXA.sol#harvest()' function harvests the provider's market assets as rewards to be distributed to stakers.
```solidity
  function harvest() public whenNotPaused {
    Market memMarket = market;
    address memProvider = provider;
    uint256 assets = Math.min(
      memMarket.convertToAssets(memMarket.allowance(memProvider, address(this))),
      memMarket.maxWithdraw(memProvider)
    );
    uint256 amount = assets.mulWadDown(providerRatio);
    IERC20 providerAsset = IERC20(address(memMarket.asset()));
    uint256 duration = rewards[providerAsset].duration;
    if (duration == 0 || amount < rewards[providerAsset].duration) return;

    memMarket.withdraw(assets, address(this), memProvider);
    uint256 save = assets - amount;
358:if (save != 0) memMarket.deposit(save, savings);

    notifyRewardAmount(providerAsset, amount, address(this));
  }
```
As you can see in #L358, the remaining assets are deposited back into `savings`.
Since the `Market` contract inherits ERC4626, the `safeTransferFrom()` function will be called here.
However, as mentioned above, the quota for `market` has not been approved, so the transaction will be reverted.
## Impact
The protocol cannot harvest the new provider's market assets as rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the following code to the `StakedEXA.sol#setMarket()` function.
```solidity
    function setMarket(Market market_) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        market = market_;

+++     IERC20 providerAsset = IERC20(address(memMarket.asset()));
+++     providerAsset.approve(address(market), type(uint256).max);

        emit MarketSet(market_, msg.sender);
    }
```
