# Missing `approve()` in the `setMarket()` function will lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) in the `harvest()` function.

## Summary

If `setMarket()` is called with a new Market address, the `approve()` function for the market asset is never performed, unlike in the `initialize()` function. This oversight causes issues in the `harvest()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `harvest()` function will revert if `providerRatio < 1e18` due to the lack of sufficient approval when executing the line `if (save != 0) memMarket.deposit(save, savings);`. 

Without the appropriate approval, this call will fail.

## Impact

The `harvest()` function will not work as expected, resulting in an inability to set a new Market address if `providerRatio < 1e18`. This will always cause a DoS in `harvest()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an `approve()` call in the `setMarket()` function similar to the one performed in the `initialize()` function.
